**Communicative Achievement** refers to how successfully the candidate uses language to complete the task in a way that is appropriate for the genre, purpose, and audience. This criterion is not about grammar or vocabulary accuracy — it is about how effectively the message is communicated.

When assessing Communicative Achievement, consider the following:

#### 1. Genre and Register
- Is the format appropriate for the task? (e.g., article, proposal, report, essay)
- Is the tone consistent and suitable for the target reader?

#### 2. Fulfilment of Communicative Purpose
- Does the candidate achieve the goal of the task (e.g., persuade, recommend, analyse)?
- Is the purpose clear and maintained throughout the text?
- Does the text engage the reader effectively?

#### 3. Complexity and Clarity of Ideas
- Are complex ideas communicated in a clear and controlled manner?
- Does the writing hold the reader’s attention?

#### 4. Reader Awareness
- Is it clear who the text is addressing?
- Is the style and content adapted to suit that reader?

#### 5. Use of Genre Conventions
- Are the conventions of the genre used naturally and skillfully?
- Does the text avoid formulaic or mechanical language?

#### 6. Balanced and Coherent Delivery
- Are ideas well-paced and logically presented?
- Is the communication smooth, natural, and appropriate in tone?
