**Language** refers to the range, accuracy, and appropriacy of the vocabulary and grammatical structures used in the writing. This criterion assesses both **how sophisticated** the candidate's language is and **how well-controlled** and **appropriate** it is for the task.

When evaluating Language, consider the following:

#### 1. Range of Vocabulary
- Is there a wide range of vocabulary, including less common and precise words?
- Does the writer avoid repetition and overused simple words (e.g., “nice,” “good,” “big”)?
- Are collocations and word forms used correctly?

#### 2. Range of Grammar
- Does the candidate use complex grammatical structures (e.g., conditionals, inversion, cleft sentences)?
- Is the grammar varied and flexible?

#### 3. Accuracy and Control
- Are grammar and vocabulary accurate throughout?
- Are errors rare and minor (i.e., slips), or do they affect communication?
- Are punctuation and spelling correct?

#### 4. Appropriacy
- Is the language suitable for the task, audience, and genre?
- Does the tone and style feel natural and consistent?
- Are there any awkward phrases or misused words?
