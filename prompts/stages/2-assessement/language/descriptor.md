> How we respond to new technologies is often a reflection of how able we are as individuals to cope with change in other areas of our lives.  
> If we feel in control, we are more likely to embrace innovation; if we are less confident, we may avoid situations which threaten or challenge us.  
>  
> **Technology at work**  
> Whether it be new software for the office, or state-of-the-art equipment for the factory, the successful introduction of new technology in the workplace requires effective, practical training in how to use it.  
> This training allows staff to become familiar with the technology before using it for real in their daily tasks.

>  
> **Write your essay.**
