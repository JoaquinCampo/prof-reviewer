**Content** refers to the degree to which the candidate has **understood and addressed the task**, as well as how **relevant and complete** the response is in relation to the task requirements. Evaluating content involves considering the following aspects:

### 1. Task Fulfilment
Has the candidate responded to all parts of the question? For example, if the task asks for advantages and disadvantages, are both included and clearly developed? Partial or incomplete answers will reduce the Content score.

### 2. Relevance of Information
Are all the ideas and examples presented in the response connected directly to the task? Responses that go off-topic, include generic filler, or shift the focus away from what was asked may lose marks in this area.

### 3. Coverage of Key Points
Does the response include all the points necessary to fully inform the target reader? Any **omissions**, such as skipping part of the prompt or failing to provide a conclusion when it's clearly required, will negatively affect the score.

### 4. Appropriacy of Detail and Support
Are ideas **sufficiently developed**? Does the writer provide appropriate explanations, evidence, or examples to support their points? Content should not be superficial or vague.

### 5. No Misinterpretation of the Task
Has the candidate understood the task correctly? Misreading the purpose or type of text (e.g., writing an opinion essay instead of a proposal) counts against Content, even if the language is otherwise strong.

### 6. Reader Awareness
Would the **target reader** be fully informed after reading the text? This means the writing must satisfy the intended audienceâ€™s expectations (e.g., a teacher, magazine reader, committee) and purpose (e.g., to inform, persuade, describe).

---

In short, strong Content shows that the candidate has read the task carefully, understood what is required, and produced a relevant, complete, and well-developed response that meets the needs of the target reader. Any **irrelevant content**, **missing parts**, or **failure to develop points appropriately** will lower the Content score.
