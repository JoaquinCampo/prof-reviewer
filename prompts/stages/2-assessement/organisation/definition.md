**Organisation** refers to how clearly and logically the ideas are structured and connected throughout the writing. It focuses on paragraphing, sequencing, linking, and overall flow — not the content itself.

When evaluating Organisation, consider the following:

#### 1. Structure and Paragraphing
- Is the text logically structured with clear progression from introduction to conclusion?
- Are paragraphs well-defined and used meaningfully?

#### 2. Coherence
- Do ideas follow one another logically?
- Is the development of arguments smooth and easy to follow?

#### 3. Cohesion (Linking)
- Are linking words and cohesive devices used appropriately and naturally?
- Is there a wide range of linking expressions (not just “and,” “but,” “because”)?

#### 4. Rhetorical Organisation
- Does the writer guide the reader through the text using techniques like signposting or contrast?
- Are relationships between ideas (e.g., cause-effect, contrast, comparison) clearly and logically expressed?
