### Student Response:

**Children’s book**

> A book that brings back endless memories of my childhood is *“The Hobbit”* by J. R. R. Tolkien.  
> **This Story** is a prequel of the trilogy *“The Lord of The Rings”* and narrates the life of an extraordinary dwarf named Bilbo Baggins.
>
> The reason why **this book** has a special place in my heart **is because** of the euphoria and excitement it brought as I was flipping through the pages as a kid after reading. The story is based on an adventure that Bilbo Baggins undergoes **after being persuaded** by an eccentric wizard called Gandalf to join him and other dwarfs. Bilbo’s life **takes a quick turn – from living in a “Hobbit Hole” to** battling bizarre creatures and monsters in the woods. The story had two intense moments that as a child left me completely hooked to the plot.
>
> The ultimate goal of the protagonist was to defeat a dragon malevolent and sinister dragon called *“Smaug”* and reclaim all of the gold that he stole from the dwarves. In **the book had** Even up to this day, I still consider Bilbo Baggins as a **heroic one of the most heroic fictional characters of because all time.** He was a normal man living in a normal word and ordinary life before he transformed into the benevolent man that made the most memorable heart–touching and ecstatic memories in this plot.
>
> The impact this book had on me was colossal. I learnt so m a great deal of values and ethics from all the characters that made a worthwhile contribution to the story — from learning to remain humble to respecting your kins and one another; to the significance of strengthening the bond between your associates and mustering the courage to take up any challenge, no matter how difficult it may seem. I strongly will also venture in to the **fact that** this book, although in classical remains highly relevant for the youth in upcoming generations, **not only because of** the valuable lessons it has to offer, **but because** of the mixed feelings of melancholy, merriness, disappointment bafflement and adrenaline rushes you may experience while reading.

### 📝 Comments on Organisation (Band 3)

- The text is a **well-organised and coherent** whole.
- Paragraphs are well structured and a **variety of cohesive devices and organisational patterns**, such as **substitution**, are used flexibly.
- Ideas are linked across sentences and paragraphs naturally:
  - *A book*; *“The Hobbit”*; *This Story*; *this book*; *is because of*; *takes a quick turn – from living in a “Hobbit Hole” to*; *not only because of ... but because of the*.
- Although there’s some lack of overt cohesion, **sentences are still well constructed** with reference to previous and upcoming ideas.


## ❓ Why not Band 5?

This is a very good response to the task overall.  
To get a higher mark for **Communicative Achievement**, the candidate could have used **genre conventions** that are more appropriate for a letter.

This means avoiding structures more suited to an essay, such as:
- Structuring paragraphs using **Firstly**, **Secondly**, **In my opinion**, **In conclusion**, etc.
- Instead, adapting the tone and format to better fit the **letter genre** would have made the response more authentic and effective.
